        Maiden King is the solo effort of Jake Hawrylak, a Santa Fe bred/Chicago
        made singer songwriter. After many years as a frequent collaborator with
        the likes of Sunjacket, Sedgewick, Reno Cruz, Leroy Bach, Marvin Tate,
        Alicia Walters, Jenn Hall, Astrachan, Claude, and Joe George, and many
        more, his self produced debut, Who Else Were We Supposed to Become? is
        set to release in the summer of 2023. The LP was written to mythologize
        a number of disparate memories that kept floating into focus during the
        early months of the pandemic. From the first moment of derealization as
        a young man; a rambunctious tale of arson in the shadow of a bigger
        fight with a friend; escaping the mire of oneâ€™s self esteem; and finally
        a moment (or two) of quiet acceptance. Though seemingly disparate, the
        coalescence of all of these began to paint a clearer picture. The title
        is completely rhetorical, a kind of matter of fact reckoning with the
        person you were always going to become and the peace that can finally
        come when you stop fighting it.
