          The LP was written to mythologize a number of disparate memories that
          kept floating into focus during the early months of the pandemic. From
          the first moment of derealization as a young man; a rambunctious tale
          of arson in the shadow of a bigger fight with a friend; escaping the
          mire of one&apos;s self esteem; and finally a moment (or two) of quiet
          acceptance. Though seemingly disparate, the coalescence of all of
          these began to paint a clearer picture. The title is completely
          rhetorical, a kind of matter of fact reckoning with the person you
          were always going to become and the peace that can finally come when
          you stop fighting it.
